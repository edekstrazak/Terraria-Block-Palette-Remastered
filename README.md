# Terraria Block Palette Remastered
A more advanced version of the previous TBP site. It has actual functionality, better design overall and some user interface elements.

Other than that, I made a custom (basic) admin panel, that lets me verify palettes submitted by users.
I can apply *tags* from db to a palette (also add a new one, if needed), remove the *username* of the submitted palette, add palette's *obtainability* and add an appropriate *title*.

It's being done in hopes of being deployed one day to help the Terraria community with their builds.
